This page exists just to say thank you to all the people whose work I've used and people who have supported me in life. 🙇‍

## Thanks to

* [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) for developing [Lanyon](https://lanyon.getpoole.com/), the excellent Jekyll theme that this site uses
* [Rasmus Andersson](https://twitter.com/rsms) for created [Inter UI](https://rsms.me/inter/), the clean, legible font that this site uses

and my parents, friends, and family for their infinite support.

*Sizi seviyorum 💛*
